    <b>Blog Post Reflection</b>

    <p class="center">
      In lab 5 of automated composition, I had a challenging yet rewarding experience for both Part I and Part II. In
      this blog post, I will be discussing my experience with implementing Magenta into Lab2 and also why and how I
      implemented Markov Chain Learning to the tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. <br>
    </p>


    <p class="center">
      Part I was challenging in that I was unfamiliar with Magenta.js. Hence, it took me a while to understand how to
      translate certain properties into elements within Lab2. The hardest part that I struggled with was adding the
      offset value into the note.startTime and note.endTime. Prior to adding the offset, my oscillators were not
      producing any notes. Another part that I was having trouble with was understanding why the oscillators in AM and
      FM continuously played even after the melody of TWINKLE_TWINKLE had ended. To fix the issue, I had to set the gain
      value to zero immediately after the attack.
    </p>

    <p class="center">
      From the difficulties in Part I, I felt more comfortable with automated composition and decided to tackle Markov
      Chain Learning. The hardest part of Markov Chain Learning was understanding how to generate the new note onto the
      Twinkle Twinkle melody. After producing the bigrams of the notes, I used Math.random() to randomly select what
      note should be produced next. Inspired by this <a
        href="https://medium.com/@alexkrameris/markov-chain-implementation-in-javascript-a698f371d66f" target="_blank">post</a>, I
      learned that by using Math.random, I can save space since
      the random function imitates the likelihood of the pitch. Currently, my Markov Chain Learning adds one new pitch
      onto the current Twinkle Twinkle Little Star Melody.
